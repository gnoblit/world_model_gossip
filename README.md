# Gossip World Models

**A research project to stabilize generative world models by enforcing mutual consistency.**

This repository explores a novel regularization technique called the **"Gossip" Protocol**. It aims to solve the "reality drift" problem in generative world models, where long-term simulations become physically implausible.

### The Core Idea

Instead of training one world model, we train two independent models (`A` and `B`) simultaneously. During training, they "dream" of future scenarios. The core of our method is a **consistency loss** that penalizes `Model A` if it cannot comprehend the dream generated by `Model B`, and vice-versa.

This "social pressure" forces both models to discard idiosyncratic fantasies and converge on a shared, physically coherent understanding of the environment's dynamics.

### Project Goals

1.  **Implement a Baseline:** Build a standard world model (VAE + RNN) on the `CarRacing-v3` environment.
2.  **Implement the Gossip Protocol:** Create a trainer that manages two world models and applies the consistency loss.
3.  **Compare Results:** Demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the gossip-trained models produce more stable and realistic long-term dreams.

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone and Setup:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gossip-world-models.git
    cd gossip-world-models
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -e .[dev,envs]
    ```

2.  **Run Tests:**
    Ensure the core components are working correctly.
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

3.  **Train Models:**
    The main training script handles both VAE and dynamics training.
    ```bash
    python main.py  # (Future main training script)
    ```

### Repository Structure

-   `models/`: Saved model checkpoints (ignored by `.gitignore`).
-   `src/gossip_wm/`: Core Python library for models, environment, etc.
-   `tests/`: Pytest suite for the library.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies.
