# Gossip World Models: Stabilizing Generative Dynamics through Social Consistency

**Project Status:** In Development

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation for the "Gossip World Models" research project. We propose a novel regularization technique to improve the long-term stability and physical plausibility of generative world models.

  <em>Figure 1: A conceptual diagram of the Gossip Protocol. Two independent models (A and B) dream about the future. They then "gossip" by showing each other the final frame of their dream. A consistency loss penalizes a model if it finds the other's dream "inconceivable," forcing both to learn a shared, plausible version of reality.</em>

## 1. The Idea

A key failure mode of generative world models is **reality drift**, where long-term simulations (dreams) diverge into physically impossible scenarios. An agent can exploit these flaws, learning policies that fail in the real environment.

Our solution, the **"Gossip" Protocol**, is a procedural check inspired by social consensus.
1.  **Two independent world models** (`A` and `B`) are trained simultaneously.
2.  Both models "dream" a future trajectory from the same starting point.
3.  They "show" each other the final frame of their dream.
4.  A **consistency loss** penalizes a model if it cannot comprehend the other's dream.
    `Loss_A = || z_A_N - Encoder_A(Decoder_B(z_B_N)) ||Â²`
This "social pressure" forces the models to discard idiosyncratic fantasies and converge on the essential, shared dynamics of the environment.

## 2. System Prerequisites

Before installing the Python packages, you must ensure the following system-level dependencies are installed.

**1. Git:**
Required for cloning this repository and installing some Python packages directly from GitHub.
-   **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`
-   **macOS (with Homebrew):** `brew install git`

**2. Java JDK 8:**
The `minerl` package specifically requires Java Development Kit version 8.
-   **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk`
-   **Fedora/CentOS:** `sudo dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel`
-   **macOS (with Homebrew):** `brew tap homebrew/cask-versions && brew install --cask temurin@8`

After installing, verify the version by opening a **new terminal** and running `java -version`. The output should mention version "1.8.0".
